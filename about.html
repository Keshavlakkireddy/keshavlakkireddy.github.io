      <h4>Goal</h4> 
      <p>This short visualization walks the reader through the diseases that top the list in causing deaths in US through the period 1999-2014. More specifically, it provides information about total deaths caused over the period 1999-2014 by each disease, which disease caused more deaths in 1999 and how this changed over time.The narrative follows an interactive slideshow structure, starting with a first scene (stats) that presents the general idea of the visualization.  Although , the first scene is interactive to a certain extent, the next scene (Trends) will allow the reader to see more details on the disease trends over the years between 1999 and 2014.

      <h4>Scenes</h4>
      <p>This first scene (Stats) is an interactive bar chart that lists deaths caused vs disease information to give reader a general idea of the total deaths caused by diseases for the period 1999-2014. After that first scene, the reader can navigate to Trends scene where the visualization will cycle through the trends for diseases to give a visual demonstration of the trends. Once the simulation is over, the visualization presents the top diseaes list on the right..</p>

      <p>The reader can also see a particular disease trend by clicking a disease. This will produce a line graph for that disease. Reader is free to pick any diesease in any order. The selected disease will stay highlighted to keep the focus on the disease the reader is currently seeing.The scenes template consists of a simple top panel and a bottom panel.  The bottom panel contains summary information for the chart displayed on the top panel. This template provides a consistency that eases the reader's navigation over the scenes</p>
      <br>
       <h4>Annotations</h4>
      <p>  The first scene ( bar graph) has tooltips that provide further information as the reader hovers over each bar in the barchart. The second scene consists of line graph text that indicates the diesease line graph represents. </p>
      <br>
 
      <h4>Parameters</h4>
      <p>The main parameter is the flow between different scenes. Each scene is referenced appropriately to ensure the switching between scenes back and forth is seamless. </p>

      <h4>Triggers</h4>
      <p>The main trigger in the stats scene,would be hovering over the bar chart. This will display the total deaths caused by the disease.Reader can click on Trends scene or click on Next button to see more details on the disease trends.In the Trends scene, after the simulation of all the diseases and trends is complete, reader can select any disease on the right and the visualization would change to show the trend of only that particular disease over the years. Also the scale changes to reflect the numbers of the disease selected by the user.</p>
